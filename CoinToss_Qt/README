# Coin-toss game

A simple Qt C++ application that demonstrates coin toss. When the user clicks a button, the application randomly selects either a "heads" or "tails" image and displays it in a separate window. The window automatically closes after 1 second.

## Dependencies

- Qt 5 or later

## Installation

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the project in Qt Creator.

## Code Structure

- `mainwindow.cpp`: Contains the logic after the "Toss Coin" button is clicked. A random number(0 or 1) is generated and the corresponding "Heads" or "Tails" image is loaded. The image window closes after 1 second.
- `mainwindow.h`: Contains the declaration of the main window class.
- `mainwindow.ui`: UI file containing the "Toss Coin" button.
- 'images/' : Image files "heads.jpeg and "tails.jpeg" can be used as a reference. 
Note: If the images fail to load, provide the absolute path of the image in the file system.
